    "plugin_instructions": "This plugin has only one action... well, 2 technically but only one you should use. Left the original action so I don't break anyones setup.\n\nCREATE A DYNAMIC CSV FILE\nTo use, add a button to your page and start a workflow when that button is clicked. The action you add will beÂ \n\nData (Things) > Create a dynamic CSV File\n\nFILE NAME\nThis can be dynamic or you can add static text here.\n\nHEADER FIELDS\nThe header field controls the header text for that column. It also controls whether that column is included in the download. If the header field is empty, the column will be ignored.\n\nNote, the header fields are dynamic. Why does this matter? Hey, give your users the ability to name the columns or choose which columns they want included in their download... tons of options available here.\n\nDATA\nEnter a dynamic search. Remember that every column should have the same search or your CSV file will be inaccurate. You can use an element such as a repeating group as your data source if it's easier. \n\nSelect a field or select a linked data type and then select a field from that object. \n\nPLEASE NOTE!!! \n\nI have removed the need to use the 'join with line_break' required with the earlier versions.\n\nWhile this makes things much simpler, if you are using the Create a Dynamic CSV action on version 1.3.1 or earlier, upgrading will break your workflow.\n\nTo resolve the issue, simply remove the join with statements from your data fields and it's ready to roll.\n\n\n\n"
